- [X] Configure frontend port (using port 3001)

## Phase 1: Preparation & Design
- [ ] Define output schemas for each data type (Customers, Drivers, Rates, etc.)
- [ ] Collect a diverse set of messy input files (multi-tab, varying formats)
- [ ] Draft mapping dictionary format (input_field, output_field, data_type, rules, confidence_score, usage_stats) - *(Schema defines structure)*
- [X] Create MongoDB schema definitions for raw input, processed entities, and dictionary - *(RawFile, ProcessedData, MappingDictionary, AnomalyReport)*
- [ ] Design UI wireframes: Upload â†’ Select Entity Type â†’ Interactive Mapping â†’ Preview/Export

## Phase 2: Backend Core + Specialized AI Agents PoC
- [ ] Build a minimal CLI PoC to test core AI functionality before UI development
- [X] Implement file upload API with:
  - [X] Support for .xlsx, .xls, and .csv files
  - [X] File size and type validation
  - [X] Blank row filtering
  - [X] Error handling
- [X] Integrate `sheetjs` to parse Excel files and normalize all tabs to JSON
- [X] Create input validation layer to catch obvious issues before AI processing
- [X] Store raw data in MongoDB (GridFS or pointer to file store) - *(RawFile schema created)*
- [X] Develop specialized OpenAI agents:
  - [X] Classification agent to identify tab content types
  - [X] Mapping agent to align fields with output schema
  - [X] Validation agent to detect anomalies and data issues
    - [X] Implement required field validation
    - [X] Add format validation (email, phone, date, etc.)
    - [X] Detect duplicate values
    - [X] Use AI for inconsistency detection
    - [X] Provide fix suggestions
- [X] Implement caching strategy for AI responses to reduce costs
- [X] Design and implement token budget management system
- [X] Save processed data with tags and metadata - *(ProcessedData schema created)*
- [ ] Implement CSV export functionality per data type
- [ ] Set up detailed logging for all AI interactions

## Phase 3: Frontend MVP
- [X] Build React UI:
  - [X] Set up React Router for navigation
  - [X] Configure Redux for state management
  - [X] Implement Tailwind CSS for styling
  - [X] Create basic layout components (Header, Footer, Layout)
  - [ ] File upload component with drag-and-drop support
  - [ ] Dropdown to select entity type
  - [ ] Progress/status display
  - [ ] Interactive mapping correction interface
  - [ ] Data preview table with anomaly flags
  - [ ] Download button for CSV export
  - [ ] Anomaly report preview

## Phase 4: Mapping Dictionary Management
- [X] Create MongoDB collection for mappings with versioning support - *(MappingDictionary schema created)*
- [ ] Build backend API for managing dictionary
- [ ] Implement dictionary evolution mechanism based on user corrections
- [ ] Develop React UI for:
  - [ ] Viewing mappings
  - [ ] Editing/adding new field rules
  - [ ] Template management for recurring file types
- [ ] Allow backend to update dictionary based on new fields found
- [X] Track usage statistics and confidence per mapping - *(Fields added to schema)*
- [ ] Implement fallback strategies for when AI can't confidently map fields

## Phase 5: Anomaly Reporting & Enhancement
- [X] Define anomaly types and rules (missing fields, duplicates, unmapped columns, etc.) - *(AnomalyReport schema created)*
- [ ] Generate anomaly reports from parsed data
- [ ] Display report in UI
- [ ] Allow download of anomaly reports
- [ ] Implement AI suggestions for fixing anomalies
- [ ] Add bulk processing support for multiple files
- [ ] Create versioning system for processed data
- [ ] Develop saved templates feature for recurring file types

## Phase 6: Infrastructure & Deployment
- [X] Dockerize backend and frontend apps early in development
- [ ] Set up AWS ECS with task definitions and autoscaling
- [ ] Configure S3 or EFS for file storage
- [X] Implement rate limiting for API endpoints - *(Dependency installed)*
- [X] Create CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions or AWS CodePipeline:
  - [X] Lint
  - [ ] Build Docker images
  - [ ] Push to ECR
  - [ ] Deploy to ECS
- [ ] Version prompt templates and mapping dictionaries

## Optional Enhancements
- [ ] Add Redis-based job queue for background file processing
- [ ] Incorporate LangChain or Semantic Kernel for orchestration
- [ ] Add telemetry/logging dashboard for prompt usage, errors, and outcomes
